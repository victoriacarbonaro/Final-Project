# Final-Project
What if AI had the capability to create physical items as quickly as it generates text? Humanity already struggles with overconsumption in nearly every aspect of life, from material goods to natural resources. Introducing a technology that allows for the instant production of physical objects could amplify this problem exponentially. The environmental toll would likely include accelerated depletion of natural resources, increased waste, and pollution beyond what current systems can handle. The ability to create without limits might also erode our sense of responsibility for the environmental and ethical consequences of production.

Humanityâ€™s tendency to overconsume has already led to significant environmental and social damage, as shown in found footage documenting the effects of overproduction and waste. In my project, I incorporate recordings of AI conversations, AI-generated images, and a fabricated news article to frame the narrative. These elements highlight how instant production technology could exacerbate overconsumption, leading to catastrophic consequences for both the planet and society.
